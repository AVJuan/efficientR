# Efficient workflow

Efficient programming is an important and sometimes vital skill for generating the correct result, on time.
Yet coding is only one part of a wider skillset needed for successful outcomes for projects involving R programming. Unless your project is to write generic R code (i.e. unless you are on the R Core Team), the project will probably transcend the confines of the R world: it must engage with a whole range of other factors.
In this context we define 'workflow' as the sum of practices, habits and systems that enable productivity.^[The Oxford Dictionary's
definition of workflow is similar, with a more industrial feel: "The sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion."
]
To some extent workflow is about personal preferences.
Everyone's mind works differently so the most appropriate workflow varies from person to person and from one project to the next. Project management practices will also vary depending the scale and type of the project.

Appropriate project management structures and workflow also vary depend on the *type* of project you are undertaking. The typology below demonstrate the links between project type and project management requirements.^[Thanks to Richard Cotton for suggesting this typology.]

- *Data analysis*.  Here you are trying to explore datasets to discover something interesting/answer some questions.  The emphasis is on speed of manipulating your data to generate interest results.  Formality is less important in this type of project.  Sometimes this analysis project may only be part of a larger project (the data may have to be created in a lab, for example). How the data analysts interact with the rest of the team may be as important for the project's success as how they interact with each other.
- *Package creation*.  Here you want to create code that can be reused across projects, possibly by people whose use case you don't know (if you make it publicly available).  The emphasis in this case will be on clarity of user interface and documentation, meaning style and code review are important.  Robustness and testing are important in this type of project too.
- *Reporting and publishing*.  Here you are writing a report or journal paper or book.  The level of formality varies depending upon the audience, but you have additional worries like how much code it takes to arrive at the conclusions, and how much output does the code create.
- *Software applications*.  This could range from a simple Shiny app to R being embedded in the server of a much larger piece of software.  Either way, since there is limited opportunity for human interaction, the emphasis is on robust code and gracefully dealing with failure.

Based on these observations we recommend thinking about the type of workflow, file structure and project management system suits your projects best. Sometimes it's best not to be prescriptive so we recommend trying different working practices to discover which works best, time permitting.^[The
importance of workflow has not gone unnoticed by the R community and there are a number of different suggestions to boost R productivity.
[Rob Hyndman](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/workflow-in-r/), for example, advocates the strategy of using four self-contained scripts to break up R work into manageable chunks: `load.R`, `clean.R`, `func.R` and `do.R`.
]

There are, however, concrete steps that can be taken to improve workflow in most projects that involve R programming.
Learning them will, in the long-run, improve productivity and reproducibility.
With these motivations in mind, the purpose of this chapter is simple: to highlight some key ingredients of an efficient R workflow.
It builds on the concept of an R/RStudio *project*, introduced in Chapter 2, and is ordered chronologically throughout the stages involved in a typical project's lifespan, from its inception to publication:

 - Project planning. This should happen before any code has been written, to avoid time wasted using a mistaken analysis strategy. Project management is the art of making project plans happen.
 
 - Package selection. After planning your project you should identify which packages are most suitable to get the work done quickly and effectively. With rapid increases in the number and performance of packages. `*_join` from **dplyr**, for example, is often more appropriate than `merge`, as we'll see in \@ref(efficient-data-carpentry). It is therefore more important than ever to consider the range of options at the outset.

 - Publication. This final stage is relevant if you want your R code to be useful for others in the long term. To this end Section \@ref(publication) touches on documentation using knitr and the much stricter approach to code publication of package development. 
 
## Project planning and management

Good programmers working on a complex project will rarely just start typing code. Instead, they will plan the steps needed to complete the task as efficiently as possible: "smart preparation minimizes work" [@berkun2005art].
Although search engines are useful for identifying the appropriate strategy, trail-and-error approaches (for example typing code at random and Googling the inevitable error messages) are usually highly *inefficient*.

Strategic thinking especially important during a project's inception: if you make a bad decision early on, it will have cascading negative impacts throughout the project's entire lifespan. So detrimental and ubiquitous is this phenomenon in software development that a term has been coined to describe it: *technical debt*. This has been defined as "not quite  right  code  which  we  postpone making it right" [@kruchten2012technical]. Dozens of academic papers have been written on the subject but, from the perspective of *beginning* a project (i.e. in the planning stage, where we are now), all you need to know is that it is absolutely vital to make sensible decisions at the outset. If you do not, your project may be doomed to failure of incessant rounds of refactoring (we return to the topic of refactoring in Chapter \@ref(efficient-collaboration)).

To minimise technical debt at the outset, the best place to start may be with a pen and paper and an open mind. Sketching out your ideas and deciding precisely what you want to do, free from the constraints of a particular piece of technology, can be rewarding exercise before you begin.
Project planning and 'visioning' can be a creative process not always well-suited to the linear logic of computing, despite recent advances in project management software, some of which are outlined in the bullet points below.

Scale can loosely be defined as the number of people working on a project. It should be considered at the outset because the importance of project management increases exponentially with the number of people involved. 
Project management may be trivial for a small project but if you expect it to grow, implementing a structured workflow early could avoid problems later.
On small projects consisting of a 'one off' script, project management may be a distracting waste of time.
Large projects involving dozens of people, on the other hand, require much effort dedicated to project management: regular meetings, division of labour and a scalable project management system to track progress, issues and
priorities will inevitably consume a large proportion of the project's time. Fortunately a multitude of dedicated project management systems have been developed to cater for projects across a range of scales. These include, in rough ascending order of scale and complexity:

- the interactive code sharing site [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is described in more detail in Chapter \@ref(efficient-collaboration))

- [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/), a browser plugin that is "the first and only project management suite that works natively within GitHub"

- web-based and easy-to-use tools such as [Trello](https://trello.com/)

- Dedicated desktop project management software such as [ProjectLibre](http://sourceforge.net/projects/projectlibre/) and [GanttProject](http://sourceforge.net/projects/projectlibre/)

- fully featured, enterprise scale open source project management systems such as [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) and [redmine](http://www.redmine.org/).


Regardless of the software (or lack thereof) used for project management, it involves considering the project's aims in the context of available resources (e.g. computational and programmer resources), project scope, timescales and suitable software. And these things should be considered together. To take one example, is it worth the investment of time needed to learn a particular R package which is not essential to completing the project but which will make the code run faster? Does it make more sense to hire another programmer or invest in more computational resources to complete an urgent deadline?

Minutes spent thinking through such issues before writing a single line can save hours in the future. This is emphasised in books such as @berkun2005art and @PMBoK_2000 and useful online resources such those by [teamgantt.com](http://teamgantt.com/guide-to-project-management/) and
[lasa.org.uk](http://www.lasa.org.uk/uploads/publications/ictpublications/computanews_guides/lcgpm.pdf),
which focus exclusively on project planning.  This section condenses some of the most important lessons from this literature in the context of typical R projects (i.e. which involve data analysis, modelling and visualisation).

### 'Chunking' your work

Once a project overview has been devised and stored, in mind (for small projects, if you trust that as storage medium!) or written, a plan with a time-line can be drawn-up.
The up-to-date visualisation of this plan can be a powerful reminder to yourself and collaborators of progress on the project so far. More importantly the timeline provides an overview of what needs to be done next.
Setting start dates and deadlines for each task will help prioritise the work and ensure you are on track.
Breaking a large project into smaller chunks is highly recommended, making huge, complex tasks more achievable and modular @PMBoK_2000.
'Chunking' the work will also make collaboration easier, as we shall see in Chapter 5.

```{r phases, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4,fig.cap="Schematic illustrations of key project phases and levels of activity over time, based on @PMBoK_2000."}
local(source("code/04-project-planning_f1.R", local=TRUE))
```

The tasks that a project should be split into will depend the nature of the work and the phases illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:phases) represent a rough starting point, not a template and the 'programming' phase will usually need to be split into at least 'data tidying', 'processing', and 'visualisation'.

### Making your workflow SMART {#smart}

A more rigorous (but potentially onerous) way to project plan is to divide the work into a series of objectives and tracking their progress throughout the project's duration.
One way to check if an objective is appropriate for action and review is by using the SMART criteria.

- Specific: is the objective clearly defined and self-contained?
- Measurable: is there a clear indication of its completion?
- Attainable: can the target be achieved?
- Realistic: have sufficient resources been allocated to the task?
- Time-bound: is there an associated completion date or milestone?

If the answer to each of these questions is 'yes', the task is likely to be suitable to include in the project's plan.
Note that this does not mean all project plans need to be uniform.
A project plan can take many forms, including a short document, a Gantt chart
(see Figure \@ref(fig:timeline) or simply a clear vision of the project's steps in mind.

```{r timeline, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A Gantt chart created using **DiagrammeR** illustrating the steps needed to complete this book at an early stage of its development."}
## Code in "code/04-project-planning_f2.R"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/DiagrammeR-gantt-book.png")
```

### R packages for planning

A number of R packages can assist with this process of formalising and visualising the project plan, including:^[For
a more comprehensive discussion of Gantt charts in R,
please refer to [stackoverflow.com/questions/3550341](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3550341/gantt-charts-with-r).]

- the [**plan**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plan/) package, which provides basic tools to create burndown charts (which concisely show whether a project is on-time or not) and Gantt charts.

- [**plotrix**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotrix/index.html), a general purpose plotting package, provides basic Gantt chart plotting functionality. Enter `example(gantt.chart)` for details.

- [**DiagrammeR**](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/), a new package for creating network graphs and other schematic diagrams in R. This package provides an R interface to simple flow-chart file formats such as [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) and [GraphViz](https://github.com/ellson/graphviz).

The small example below (which provides the basis for creating charts like Figure \@ref(fig:timeline) illustrates how **DiagrammeR** can take simple text inputs to create informative up-to-date Gantt charts.
Such charts can greatly help with the planning and task management of long and complex R projects, as long as they do not take away valuable programming time from core project objectives. {#DiagrammeR}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("DiagrammeR")
# Define the Gantt chart and plot the result (not shown)
mermaid("gantt
        Section Initiation
        Planning           :a1, 2016-01-01, 10d
        Data processing    :after a1  , 30d")
```

In the above code `gantt` defines the subsequent data layout.
`Section` refers to the project's section (useful for large projects, with milestones) and each new line refers to a discrete task.
`Planning`, for example, has the code `a`, begins on the first day of 2016 and lasts for 10 days. See [knsv.github.io/mermaid/gantt.html](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/gantt.html)
for more detailed documentation.

## Package selection {#pkgs}

A good example of the importance of prior planning to minimise effort is package selection.
An inefficient, poorly supported or simply outdated package can waste hours.
When a more appropriate alternative is available this waste can be prevented by prior planning.
There are many poor packages on CRAN and much duplication so it's easy to go wrong.
Just because a certain package *can* solve a particular problem, doesn't mean that it *should*.

However, used well, packages can greatly improve productivity.
Due to the conservative nature of base R development, which rightly prioritises stability over innovation, much of the innovation and performance gains in the 'R ecosystem' has occurred in recent years in the packages.
The increased ease of package development [@Wickham_2015] and interfacing with other languages [e.g. @Eddelbuettel_2011] has accelerated their number, quality and efficiency.
An additional factor has been the growth in collaboration and peer review in package development, driven by code-sharing websites such as GitHub and online communities such as [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) for peer reviewing code.

Performance, stability and ease of use should be high on the priority list when choosing which package to use.
Another more subtle factor is that some packages work better together than others.
The 'R package ecosystem' is composed of interrelated package.
Knowing something of these inter-dependencies can help select a 'package suite' when the project demands a number of diverse yet interrelated programming tasks.
The 'hadleyverse', for example, contains many interrelated packages that work well together, such as **readr**, **tidyr**, and **dplyr**.^[An excellent overview of the 'hadleyverse' and its benefits is available from [barryrowlingson.github.io/hadleyverse](https://barryrowlingson.github.io/hadleyverse).]
These may be used together to read-in, tidy and then process the data, as outlined in the subsequent sections.

There is no 'hard and fast' rule about which package you should use and new packages are emerging all the time.
The ultimate test will be empirical evidence:
does it get the job done on your data?
However, the following criteria should provide a good indication of whether a package is worth an investment of your precious time, or even installing on your computer:

- **Is it mature?** The more time a package is available, the more time it will have for obvious bugs to be ironed out. The age of a package on CRAN can be seen from its Archive page on CRAN. We can see from [cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot2/](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot2/), for example, that **ggplot2** was first released on the 10^th^ June 2007 and that it has had 28 releases.
The most recent of these at the time of writing was **ggplot2** 2.0.0:
reaching 1 or 2 in the first digit of package versions is usually an indication from the package author that the package has reached a high level of stability.

- **Is it actively developed?** It is a good sign if packages are frequently updated. A frequently updated package will have its latest version 'published' recently on CRAN. The CRAN package page for **ggplot2**, for example, said `Published: 2015-12-18`, less than a month old at the time of writing.

- **Is it well documented?** This is not only an indication of how much thought, care and attention has gone into the package. It also has a direct impact on its ease of use. Using a poorly documented package can be inefficient due to the hours spent trying to work out how to use it! To check if the package is well documented, look at the help pages associated with its key functions (e.g. `?ggplot`), try the examples (e.g. `example(ggplot)`) and search for package vignettes (e.g. `vignette(package = "ggplot2")`).

- **Is it well used?** This can be seen by searching for the package name online. Most packages that have a strong user base will produce thousands of results when typed into a generic search engine such as Google's. More specific (and potentially useful) indications of use will narrow down the search to particular users. A package widely used by the programming community will likely visible GitHub. At the time of writing a search for [**ggplot2**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ggplot2) on GitHub yielded over 400 repositories and almost 200,000 matches in committed code!
Likewise, a package that has been adopted for use in academia will tend to be mentioned in Google Scholar (again, **ggplot2** scores extremely well in this measure, with over 5000 hits).

An article in [simplystats](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/11/06/how-i-decide-when-to-trust-an-r-package/) discusses this issue with reference to the proliferation of GitHub packages (those that are not available on CRAN). In this context well-regarded and experienced package creators and 'indirect data' such as amount of GitHub activity are also highlighted as reasons to trust a package.

## Importing data

Before reading in data, it is worth considering a general principle for reproducible data management: never modify raw data files. Raw data should be seen as read-only, and contain information about its provenance. Keeping the original file name and including a comment about its origin are a couple of ways to improve reproducibility, even when the data are not publicly available. This is illustrated below with functions
`download.file`^[Since
R 3.2.3 the base function `download.file()` can be used to download from secure (`https://`) connections on any operating system.
]
and `unzip` to download and unzip the
dataset.
This illustrates how R can automate processes that are often performed manually, e.g. through the graphical user interface of a web browser. The result of the code below is data stored neatly in the `data` directory ready to be read-in (note part of the dataset is also stored in the **efficient** package).

```{block, dutch-data, type='rmdnote'}
The data downloaded below is a multi-table dataset on Dutch naval expeditions used with permission from the CWI Database Architectures Group and described more fully at [monetdb.org](https://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/UserGuide/MonetDB-R). From this dataset we primarily use the 'voyages' table with lists Dutch shipping expeditions by their date of departure.
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url = "https://www.monetdb.org/sites/default/files/voc_tsvs.zip"
download.file(url, "voc_tsvs.zip") # download file
unzip("voc_tsvs.zip", exdir = "data") # unzip files
file.remove("voc_tsvs.zip") # tidy up by removing the zip file
```

```{block, read-url, type='rmdtip'}
To avoid the file download stage, many functions for reading in data can accept urls and read directly from the internet. This is illustrated below for `read.csv()`:
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url = "https://www.osha.gov/dep/fatcat/FatalitiesFY10.csv"
df = read.csv(url)
```

There are now many R packages to assist with the download and import of data. The organisation [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) supports a number of these.
The example below illustrates this using the WDI package (not supported by ROpenSci) which accesses the World Bank's World Development Indicators:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("WDI") # load the WDI library (must be installed)
WDIsearch("CO2") # search for data on a topic
df = WDI(indicator = "EN.CO2.TRAN.ZS" ) # import data
```

There will be situations where you cannot download the data directly or when the data cannot be made available. In this case, simply providing a comment relating to the data's origin (e.g. `# Downloaded from http://example.com`) before referring to the dataset can greatly improve the utility of the code to yourself and others. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Not shown as a distraction (RL)
# download data from nasa, as described here:
# http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/recipes/?q=recipes/How-to-Read-Data-in-netCDF-Format-with-R
library("raster") # requires the ncdf4 package to be installed
r = raster("data/nc_3B42.20060101.03.7A.HDF.Z.ncml.nc")
```

### Fast data reading {#fread}

There is often more than one way to read data into R. Even a simple `.csv` file can be imported using a range of methods, with implications for computational efficiency. This section looks at three approaches: base R's plain text reading functions such as `read.delim`, which are derived from `read.table`; the **data.table** approach, which uses the function `fread`; and the newer **readr** package which provides `read_csv` and other `read_` functions such as `read_tsv`.

```{block, read-table-csv, type='rmdnote'}
Note that a function 'derived from' another in this context means that it calls another function. The functions such as `read.csv` and `read.delim` in fact are *wrappers* for the more generic function `read.table`. This can be seen in the source code of `read.csv`, for example, which shows that the function is roughly the equivalent of `read.table(file, header = TRUE, sep = ","`.
```


Although this section is focussed on reading text files, it demonstrate the wider principle that the speed and flexibility advantages of additional read functions can be offset by the disadvantages of addition package dependency (in terms of complexity and maintaining the code) for small datasets. The real benefits kick in on large datasets. Of course, there are some data types that *require* a certain package to load in R: the readstata13 package, for example, was developed solely to read in `.dta` files generated by versions of Stata 13 and above.

Figure \@ref(fig:readr-vs-base) demonstrates that the relative performance gains of the **data.table** and **readr** approaches increase with data size, especially so for data with many rows. Below around 1 MB `read.delim` is actually *faster* than `read_csv` while `fread` is much faster than both, although these savings are likely to be inconsequential for such small datasets.

For files beyond 100 MB in size `fread` and `read_csv` can be expected to be around *5 times faster* than `read.delim`. This efficiency gain may be inconsequential for a one-off file of 100 MB running on a fast computer (which still take less than a minute with `read.csv`), but could represent an important speed-up if you frequently load large text files. 

```{r readr-vs-base, fig.cap="Benchmarks of `base`, `data.table` and `readr` functions for reading csv files. The facets ranging from 2 to 200 represent the number of columns in the csv file..", echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
local(source("code/04-project-planning_f3.R", local=TRUE))
```

When tested on a large (4 GB) .csv file it was found that `fread` and `read_csv` were almost identical in load
times and that `read.csv` took around 5 times longer. This consumed more than 10 GB of RAM, making it unsuitable to
run on many computers (see Section \@ref(ram) for more on memory). Note that both **readr** and base methods can be
made significantly faster by pre-specifying the column types at the outset, e.g.

```{r eval=FALSE}
read.csv(file_name, colClasses = c("numeric", "numeric"))
```

See the associated help files for further details.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# This script illustrates the download and processing of a massive (~4 Gb) csv file
# Aim is to test read times on large datasets
url = "http://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPPES_Data_Dissemination_Aug_2015.zip"

# download a large dataset - don't run
download.file(url, "data/largefile.zip")
# unzip the compressed file, measure time
system.time( 
  unzip("data/largefile.zip", exdir = "data")
  )
##    user  system elapsed 
##  34.380  22.428 193.145

bigfile = "data/npidata_20050523-20150809.csv"
file.info(bigfile) # file info (not all shown)
##       size: 5647444347

system.time(df1 = read.csv(bigfile))
system.time(df2 = fread(bigfile))
system.time(df3 = read_csv(bigfile))
## Error (from 32 bit machine): cannot allocate vector of 32.0 Mb
```

<!-- Idea: test the functions on text data -->

In some cases with R programming there is a trade-off between speed and robustness. This is illustrated below with reference to differences in how **readr**, **data.table** and base R approaches handle unexpected values. Table \@ref(tab:voyages) shows that `read_tsv` is around 3 times faster, re-enforcing the point that the benefits of efficient functions increase with dataset size (made with Figure \@ref(fig:readr-vs-base)). This is a small (1 MB) dataset: the relative difference between `fread` and `read_` functions will tend to decrease as dataset size increases.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("microbenchmark")
library("readr")
library("data.table")
fname = system.file("extdata/voc_voyages.tsv", package = "efficient")
res_v = microbenchmark(times = 10,
  base_read = voyages_base <- read.delim(fname),
  readr_read = voyages_readr <- read_tsv(fname),
  dt_fread = voyages_dt <- fread(fname))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# saveRDS(res_v, "data/res_v.Rds") # re-save if updated
res_v = readRDS("data/res_v.Rds")
```

```{r voyages-pre, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
# Running results here (not in benchmark) for fast build
library("microbenchmark")
library("readr")
library("data.table")
fname = system.file("extdata/voc_voyages.tsv", package = "efficient")
voyages_base = read.delim(fname)
voyages_readr = read_tsv(fname)
voyages_dt = fread(fname)
df = print(res_v)
df = dplyr::select(df, Function = expr, min, mean, max)
df[2:ncol(df)] = df[2:ncol(df)] / df$mean[3]
```

```{r voyages, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df, caption = "Execution time of base, **readr** and **data.table** functions for reading in a 1 MB dataset relative to the mean execution time of `fread`, around 0.02 seconds on a modern computer.", digits = 1)
```

The benchmark above produces warning messages (not shown) for the `read_tsv` and `fread` functions but not the slowest base function `read.delim`. An exploration of these functions can shed light on the speed/robustness trade-off.

- The **readr** function `read_csv` generates a warning for row 2841 in the `built` variable.
This is because `read_*()` decides what class each variable is based on the first 1000 rows, rather than all rows, as base `read.*` functions do.

As illustrated by printing the result for the row which generated a warning, the `read_tsv` output is more sensible than the `read.delim` output: `read.delim` coerced the date field into a factor based on a single entry which is a text. `read_tsv` coerced the variable into a numeric vector, as illustrated below. 

```{r}
class(voyages_base$built) # coerced to a factor
class(voyages_readr$built) # numeric based on first 1000 rows
voyages_base$built[2841] # contains the text responsible for coercion
voyages_readr$built[2841] # an NA: text cannot be converted to numeric
```

- The **data.table** function `fread` generates 5 warning messages stating that columns 2, 4, 9, 10 and 11 were `Bumped to type character on data row ...`, with the offending rows printed in place of `...`. Instead of changing the offending values to `NA`, as **readr** does for the `built` column (9), `fread` automatically converts any columns it thought of as numeric into characters.

To summarise, the differences between base, **readr** and **data.table** functions for reading in data go beyond code execution times. The functions `read_csv` and `fread` boost speed partially at the expense of robustness because they decide column classes based on a small sample of available data. The similarities and differences between the approaches are summarised for the Dutch shipping data (described in a note at the beginning of this section) in Table \@ref(tab:colclasses).

```{r colclasses, echo=FALSE}
vcols = as.data.frame(rbind(
  sapply(voyages_base, class),
  sapply(voyages_readr, class),
  sapply(voyages_dt, class)))
vcols = cbind(df[1], vcols)
vcols = dplyr::select(vcols, Function, number, boatname, built, departure_date)
knitr::kable(vcols, caption = "Execution time of base, **readr** and **data.table** functions for reading in a 1 MB dataset")
```

Table \@ref(tab:colclasses) shows 4 main similarities and differences between the three read types of read function:

- For uniform data such as the 'number' variable in Table \@ref(tab:colclasses), all reading methods yield the same result (integer in this case).
- For columns that are obviously characters such as 'boatname', the base method results in factors (unless `stringsAsFactors` is set to `TRUE`) whereas `fread` and `read_csv` functions return characters.
- For columns in which the first 1000 rows are of one type but which contain anomalies, such as 'built' and 'departure_data' in the shipping example, `fread` coerces the result to characters.
`read_csv` and siblings, by contrast, keep the class that is correct for the first 1000 rows and sets the anomalous records to `NA`. This is illustrated in \@ref(tab:colclasses), where `read_tsv` produces a `numeric` class for the 'built' variable, ignoring the non numeric text in row 2841.
- `read_*` functions generate objects of class `tbl_df`, an extension of the `data.frame`, as discussed in Section  \@ref(dplyr). `fread` generates objects of class `data.table`. These can be used as standard data frames but differ subtly in their behaviour.

The wider point associated with these tests is that functions that save time can also lead to additional considerations or complexities your workflow. Taking a look at what is going on 'under the hood' of fast functions to increase speed, as we have done in this section, can help understand the knock-on consequences of choosing fast functions over slower functions from base R. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# # This was a final sentence from the previous paragraph that I've removed for now: 
# In some cases there will be no knock-on consequences of using faster functions provided by packages but you should be aware that it is a possibility. 
# I've removed this for now as it's such a large and unwieldy dataset
url = "http://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPPES_Data_Dissemination_Aug_2015.zip"
download.file(url, "largefile.zip") # takes many minutes
unzip("largefile.zip", exdir = "data") # many minutes
bigfile = "npidata_20050523-20150809.csv"
file.info(bigfile) # file info (4 GB+)
# split -b1000m npidata_20050523-20150809.csv # original command commented out
```

### Preprocessing outside R

There are circumstances when datasets become too large to read directly into R.
Reading in 4 GB text file using the functions tested above, for example, consumed all available RAM on an 16 GB machine!
To overcome the limitation that R reads all data directly into RAM, external *stream processing* tools can be used to preprocess large text files.
The following command, using the shell command `split`, for example, would break a large multi GB file many one GB chunks, each of which is more manageable for R:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
split -b100m bigfile.csv
```

The result is a series of files, set to 100 MB each with the `-b100m` argument in the above code. By default these will be called `xaa`, `xab` and which could be read in *one chunk at a time* (e.g. using `read.csv`, `fread` or `read_csv`, described in the previous section) without crashing most modern computers.

Splitting a large file into individual chunks may allow it to be read into R.
This is not an efficient way to import large datasets, however, because it results in a non-random sample of the data this way.
A more efficient way to work with very large datasets is via databases.

### Working with databases

Instead of loading all the data into RAM, as R does, databases query data from the hard-disk. This can allow a subset of a very large dataset to be defined and read into R quickly, without having to load it first.

R can connect to databases in a number of ways. The most mature of these is via the **RODBC** package, which sets up links to external databases using the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API. The functionality of **RODBC** is described in the package's vignette, accessed with `vignette("RODBC")`.
**RODBC** connects to 'traditional' databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite.

The function used to set-up a connection to an external database with RODBC is `odbcConnect`, which takes Data Source Name (`dsn =`), User ID (`uid =`) and password (`pwd`) as required arguments.

```{block, password-tip, type='rmdtip'}
Be sure never to release your password by entering it directly into the command. Instead, we recommend saving sensitive information such as database passwords and API keys in `.Renviron`, described in \@ref(renviron).
Assuming you had saved your password as the environment variable `PSWRD`, you could enter `pwd = Sys.getenv("PSWRD")` to minimise the risk of exposing your password through accidentally releasing the code or your session history.
```

Recently there has been a shift to the 'noSQL' approach for storing large datasets.
This is illustrated by the emergence and uptake of software such as MongoDB and Apache Cassandra, which have R interfaces via packages [mongolite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mongolite/index.html) and [RJDBC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJDBC/index.html), which can connect to Apache Cassandra data stores and any source compliant with the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API.

MonetDB is a recent alternative to traditional and noSQL approaches which offers substantial efficiency advantages for handling large datasets [@kersten2011researcher].
A tutorial on the [MonetDB website](https://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/UserGuide/MonetDB-R) provides an excellent introduction to handling databases from within R. A new development showcased in this tutorial is the ability to interact with databases using exactly the same syntax used to interact with R objects stored in RAM. This innovation was made possible by **dplyr**, an R library for data processing that aims to provide a unified 'front end' to perform a wide range of analysis task on datasets using a variety of 'back ends' which do the number crunching. This is one of the main advantages of **dplyr**
(see Section \@ref(dplyr)).


## Publication

<!-- Thought: this should be more about 'getting your work out there' than packages-->

The final stage in a typical project workflow is publication. This could be a report containing graphics produced by R, an online platform for exploring results or well-documented code that colleagues can use to improve their workflow. In every case the programming principles of reproducibility, modularity and DRY discussed in Chapter \@ref(programming) will make your publications faster to write, easier to maintain and more useful to others.

Instead of attempting a comprehensive treatment of the topic we will touch briefly on a couple of ways of documenting your work in R: dynamic reports and R packages. There is a wealth of material on each of these online. A wealth of online resources exists on each of these; to avoid duplication of effort the focus is on documentation from a workflow efficiency perspective.

### Dynamic documents with knitr

When writing a report using R outputs a typical workflow has historically been to 1) do the analysis 2) save the resulting graphics and record the main results outside the R project and 3) open a program unrelated to R such as LibreOffice to import and communicate the results in prose. This is inefficient: it makes updating and maintaining the outputs difficult (when the data changes, steps 1 to 3 will have to be done again) and there is an overhead involved in jumping between incompatible computing environments.

To overcome this inefficiency in the documentation of R outputs the **knitr** package was developed. Used in conjunction with RStudio and building on a version of Markdown that accepts R code (RMarkdown, saved as .Rmd files) **knitr** allows for documents to be generated automatically. Results are generated *on the fly* by including 'code chunks' such as that illustrated below:

```{r}
(1:5)^2
```

The resulting output is evaluated each time the document is compiled. To tell **knitr** that `(1:5)^2` is R code that needs to be evaluated, it must by preceded by ` ```{r} ` on the line before the R code, and ` ``` ` at the end of the chunk. When you adapt to this workflow it is highly efficient, especially as RStudio provides a number of shortcuts that make it easy to create and modify code chunks. When the data or analysis code changes, the results will be updated in the document automatically. This can save hours of fiddly copying and pasting of R output between different programs.

Furthermore dynamic documents written in RMarkdown can compile into a range of output formats including html, pdf and Microsoft's docx. There is a wealth of information on the details of dynamic report writing that is not worth replicating here. Key references are RStudio's excellent website on RMarkdown hosted at [rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and, for a more detailed account of dynamic documents with R, [@xie2015dynamic].

### R packages

A strict approach to project management and workflow is treating your projects as R packages. This is good practice in terms of learning to correctly document your code, store example data, and even (via vignettes) ensure reproducibility. This approach to R workflow is appropriate for managing complex projects which repeatedly use the same routines which can be converted into functions. Creating project packages can provide foundation for generalising your code for use by others, e.g. via publication on GitHub or CRAN.

The number of essential elements of R packages differentiate them from other R projects. Three of these are outlined below from an efficiency perspective.

- The [`DESCRIPTION`](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html) file contains key information about the package, including which packages are required for the code contained in your package to work, e.g. using `Imports:`. This is efficient because it means that anyone who installs your package will automatically install the other packages that it depends on.

- The `R/` folder contains all the R code that defines your package's functions. Placing your code in a single place and encouraging you to make your code modular in this way can greatly reduce duplication of code on large projects. Furthermore the documentation of R packages through [Roxygen tags](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html#man-workflow) such as `#' This function does this...` makes it easy for others to use your work.

- The `data/` folder contains example code for demonstrating to others how the functions work and transporting datasets that will be frequently used in your workflow. Data can be added automatically to your package project using the **devtools** package, with `devtools::use_data()`. This can increase efficiency by providing a way of distributing small to medium sized datasets and making them available when the package is loaded with the function `data('data_set_name')`.

As with dynamic documents, package development is a large topic. For small 'one-off' projects the time taken in learning how to set-up a package may not be worth the savings. However packages provide a rigourous way of storing code, data and documentation that can greatly boost productivity in the long-run. For more on R packages see [@Wickham_2015].
