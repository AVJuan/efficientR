@article{Codd1979,
  abstract =     {During the last three or four years several investigators have
                  been exploring “semantic models” for formatted databases. The
                  intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of
                  the meaning of the data so that database design can become
                  more systematic and the database system itself can behave more
                  intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear: (I) the search for
                  meaningful units that are as small as possible--atomic
                  semantics; (2) the search for meaningful units that are larger
                  than the usual n-ary relation-molecular semantics. In this
                  paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support
                  certain atomic and molecular semantics. These extensions
                  represent a synthesis of many ideas from the published work in
                  semantic modeling plus the introduction of new rules for
                  insertion, update, and deletion, as well as new algebraic
                  operators.},

                  applying author Hadley Wickham’s package development
                  philosophy. In the process, you’ll work with devtools,

                  common development tasks. Devtools encapsulates best practices

                  programming language.Ideal for developers, data scientists,

                  with the basics and shows you how to improve your package
