## Major 

## Chapter 5

Short sections, with tips. The chapter shouldn't try and teach `ggplot2`.

  * Top 5 tips (CSG/RL)
  * Saving files (CSG)
    - File type: pdf vs png (CSG)
    - Cairo graphics (CSG)
  * Efficient base graphics (RL)
    * Custom palettes (CSG)
  * ggplot2 (RL)
    - I think just illustrate facets and a few stats. 
  * Interactive graphics (RL)
    * plotly, shiny, leaflet, htmlwidgets (RL)
    - Again, short and to the point.

## Minor tweaks

  * Chapter 9: Refactoring code exercises (RL) - minor
